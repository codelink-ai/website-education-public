[{"categories":["data science"],"contents":" We\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce you to an awesome spatial (geographic) data visualization tool: keplergl.\nKeplergl is completely open source by Uber and is the default tool for spatial data visualization within Uber.\nThrough its open interface package keplergl for Python, we can pass in a variety of formats of data by writing Python code in jupyter notebook, and use its built-in rich spatial data visualization functions in its interactive window embedded in notebook. Here are 3 main addresses for learning.\n  the official website address: https://kepler.gl/\n  jupyter notebook manual address: https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/tree/master/docs/keplergl-jupyter#geojson\n  Case study address: https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/tree/master/bindings/kepler.gl-jupyter/notebooks\n  Installation  The installation of keplergl is very simple.\npip install keplergl Amazing graphics  A wave of stunning graphics are coming.\n Getting Started  import pandas as pd import geopandas as gpd from keplergl import KeplerGl # Create an object kep1 = KeplerGl(height=600) # Activate the object and load it into jupyter notebook kep1 As you can see, after running the basic code in Jupyter directly generated the built-in graphics, the graphics themselves are also dynamic; dark black background is also my favorite:\nAdding data  By default, keplergl can add 3 types of data:\n csv GeoJSON DataFrame  csv format There is a csv data in the local directory: china.csv, which records the latitude and longitude of each province in China.\nwith open(\u0026#34;china.csv\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) as f: csv_data = f.read() # add_data add data kep1.add_data(data=csv_data, name=\u0026#34;csv_kep\u0026#34;) kep1  DataFrame format china = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;china.csv\u0026#34;) kep1.add_data(data=china, name=\u0026#34;dataframe_kep\u0026#34;) kep1  GeoJson format url = \u0026#39;http://eric.clst.org/assets/wiki/uploads/Stuff/gz_2010_us_040_00_500k.json\u0026#39; country_gdf = gpd.read_file(url) # geopandas read json file kep1.add_data(data=country_gdf, name=\u0026#34;state\u0026#34;) kep1  Custom graphics  Keplergl\u0026rsquo;s customization method: the criticality button. Once inside, you can customize the operation\n Saving and reusing configurations The configuration of the instantiated kep can be saved and reused in the following instance objects.\n Save.  # Save as a file with open(\u0026#39;config1.py\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) as f: f.write(\u0026#39;config={}\u0026#39;.format(kep1.config)) # Run: magic command %run %run config1.py Reuse  kep2 = KeplerGl(height=400, data={\u0026#34;layer1\u0026#34;:df}, config=kep1.config # configuration of kep1 ) kep2 Save graphics   minimalist version, mainly the file name  kep1.save_to_html(file_name=\u0026#34;first_kep.html\u0026#34;) full version: file name, configuration, data, readability  # 4 parameters kep1.save_to_html(file_name=\u0026#34;first_kep.html\u0026#34;, data={\u0026#39;data_1\u0026#39;:china}, config=config, read_only=True ) Web app  The operations shown above are all done in the notebook, we can also do them directly online: https://kepler.gl/demo\nWe will share more articles after we have studied this tool seriously, this library is worth studying\n Source: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/t-X8NtuYXY-lKPOrSY3aPQ\n","date":"02 Jan, 2022","image":"images/blog/post-1.webp","permalink":"https://codelink.ai/blog/data-science/spatial-data-visualization-wizard-keplergl/","tags":["visualization","python"],"title":"Spatial data visualization wizard keplergl"},{"categories":["web development"],"contents":" We recommend several popular websites that can help improve your programming efficiency.\nCodepen  Demo video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1im4y1X7zb/\nHere you can find a lot of front-end code written by coding guru. In addition to various web layout codes, there are more kinds of fun, cool and novel front-end animations and effects.\nFor example, when Christmas is coming, many of you asked if I could draw a Christmas tree with code.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t, but if you type \u0026ldquo;Christmas Tree\u0026rdquo; in this website, you can see different styles of Christmas tree pages!\nClick on the page you like and you\u0026rsquo;ll be taken to the code editing page, where you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-end code and view the results in real time in the area at the bottom, which is very convenient!\nAfter editing a web page, you can browse it in full screen, favorite, clone, share, etc. in the menu at the bottom right corner of the web page, and directly embed the web page into our own project or download the complete code package to local.\nThanks to the development of front-end technology, this site provides developers with a one-stop service to search for projects, edit them online, and share and export them, making it easy for us to learn other people\u0026rsquo;s good code in an independent practice.\nHere are a few more similar sites.\nCodeSandbox  CodeSandbox, as the name suggests, helps you run front-end projects in an isolated environment.\nHere you can create your own sandboxes (projects) based on rich templates for common front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, VuePress, Svelte, etc..\nOnce you create your sandbox, you can edit your code online, view your results in real time, or share your sandbox with other people.\nJSFiddle  JSFiddle is a front-end development practice, you can also write code online and view the effect in real time. Compared with Codepen, I feel that this site has a better editing experience.\nWhen you see a great piece of JS code or plugin on the web, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to download it locally. Paste the code directly into JSFiddle and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see it in action in the fastest way possible. Many front-end component libraries now also use this platform to give developers a WYSIWYG experience.\nJSRUN  China\u0026rsquo;s online programming site, in addition to front-end, even supports online debugging and running of up to 30 programming languages!\nLike Codepen, you can see many code snippets written by others here and download them directly. You can also save and share your code, and create your own little code collection.\nI have to say, this site is one of the best in China, with great access and functionality!\nGitpod  This platform is a bit more advanced than the above mentioned sites. It is a powerful online IDE (Integrated Programming Environment) that provides a VSCode-style editor that allows you to write code online to complete your development.\nGitpod is based on container technology and will help you compile, build, and run any GitHub project, not just the front end, with one click! And each project runs in isolation from each other, so you can create them as you go and recycle them whenever you\u0026rsquo;re done.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve got your eye on a GitHub project and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to build it locally to see how it works, the best way to build and run it online is with Gitpod. There are more and more GitHub projects that have access to Gitpod, and if you see the button below, you can deploy it with one click, which is much more efficient!\nSource: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VJtMNyhAYROYURfBa1nKfw\n","date":"27 Dec, 2021","image":"images/blog/post-2.webp","permalink":"https://codelink.ai/blog/web-development/a-few-of-this-years-super-hot-programming-sites/","tags":["tool","javascript"],"title":"A few of this year's super-hot programming sites!"},{"categories":["web development"],"contents":" There is no doubt: making good use of online resources and tools can speed up development, improve quality, and make life more Chill 😎~.\nThis article brings you 10 great free web resources for front-end developers ⭐ 😎 (๑-̀ㅂ-́)و✧\n1.

Damn, it\u0026rsquo;s so well done ╮(╯▽▽)╭\n6. Carbon  People often ask: \u0026ldquo;How do I generate such nice code snippets?\u0026rdquo; and the answer is in Carbon!\nYou can generate code snippets for various themes and languages and export them as images or copy them to other platforms, it\u0026rsquo;s really nice to use 👌 👌 👌 comfortable~~\n7. Dribbble  For web design inspiration, look no further than Dribbble!!!\nWhen you see other people\u0026rsquo;s backend designs, you want to go back and rip up your own 🐶\n8. Animista  Css animation, copy the code and you can use it! No installation, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it sound good?\n9.
